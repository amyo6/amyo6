## Let me introduce myself... 👩🏾‍🦱

Hi there! 👋🏽 I recently graduated from the University of Washington’s Information School with a degree in Informatics, concentrating in Data Science and minoring in Business Administration. I’m passionate about leveraging data and analytics to solve real-world problems—particularly through data cleaning, building clear and insightful dashboards, and mentoring others to strengthen their data skills and confidence.

I’ve worked as a Data Analytics Intern, where I used tools like Power BI, Microsoft SQL Server, and Excel to develop data-driven solutions to complex business challenges. I also served as a teaching assistant and mentor, supporting students as they built their foundations in information science—breaking down tough topics, sharing resources, and cheering them on along the way.

Beyond the classroom, I am deeply engaged in exploring and writing about the evolving technology and digital landscape. I recently had the honor of publishing an article in the iJournal that critically examines the role of misinformation in today’s digital environment.

I’ve enjoyed working with data throughout my academic career and look forward to continuing to use it to drive informed decisions and create solutions that make a meaningful impact.
